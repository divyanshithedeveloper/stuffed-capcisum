#TO MAKE THE STUFFING-:
first of all, let's  boil the potatoes till they completely tender and cooked thoroughly. Peel and grate the potatoes. Keep aside.
Then,Slice off the tops of the capsicum. Remove the seeds. Rinse them in water and pat dry with a kitchen towel. Keep aside.Afterwards, In a small frying pan, heat oil.

Stir again.Add the potatoes and mix everything,saute the potatoes for 2 mins and then add garam masala powder, dry mango powder and salt.Stir well and then add chopped coriander leaves. Mix again and let this spiced potato stuffing become warm or cool down.

#STUFFING PROCESS-:
With a spoon or with your hands, stuff the potato mixture in the capsicum.

#COOKING STUFFED CAPSICUM-:
Now you can bake them or saute in a pan. I have mentioned the baking instructions in the recipe details above. Heat oil in a pan or kadai/wok and place the stuffed capsicum in the pan.Cover the pan and allow the stuffed capsicum to cook on a low flame. You will have to check often after every 5 to 6 mins and keep on changing the sides of the capsicum so that all sides are cooked well. Check, turn the sides and cover the pan again. You also have to place the open potato side touching the pan.
